# Machine-Learning-for-PLC-Control-Code
Learning PLC Control Code from archived data

PLCs are widely used for industrial automation. PLCs are complemented with
historians, which has the job to archive data for monitoring and troubleshooting.
Our aim is to learn PLC control logic from the archived data. The reverse engineering
of deducing logic from data can help in many ways. Data can show hidden
relationships among different signals that a programmer might not have utilized for
programming. In another situation, if a hacker gets access to the historical archived
data, he can launch targeted attacks without triggering any alarm in the system.
Learning logic from archived data can also help in troubleshooting any problem
during normal plant operation. A problem in normal operation of the plant can
significantly change data trend that can be captured in the logic.

The ipynb files show different machine learning approaches used for leanring the control code from data.
